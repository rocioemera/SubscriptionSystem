Feature B- Group 6
For part 3, you will design and implement a feature that allows users to subscribe to available subscription-packages. Users must be able to search for all available subscription-packages they want by entering a searching string (e.g. product or service name), returning a listing, select a package, product or service to subscribe to, and then complete the subscription (for this part, just 'confirming' a subscribe will suffice -- there is no need to emulate a payment system. Users can request for canceling their subscription to a package or service, and only administrators can approve any cancelation requests.
